This is an Among Us clone made in Rust, mostly as an exercise. I am in no
affiliation with Innersloth, the wonderful guys that made the original
[Among Us](https://store.steampowered.com/app/945360/Among_Us/) and now are
planning to make Among Us 2. I simply wanted to make a sandbox where I could 
change little details about the game without modifying the simplicity of the
original.

Hell, if Innersloth notices and likes it, I'll gladly hand the code to them. I
promise I mean no harm to them!
