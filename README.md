This is a game written in Rust that resembles the game Among Us in basic
gameplay, but adds new maps, new tasks, tweaks some basic gameplay, adds
customization and quality of life fixes. It retains the online multiplayer of
the original.

I am in no affiliation with Innersloth, the wonderful guys that made the 
original [Among Us](https://store.steampowered.com/app/945360/Among_Us/) and 
now are planning to make Among Us 2. I simply wanted to make a sandbox where I 
could change details about the game without modifying the basic
mechanics of the original.
